# Student Performance #
Here is a dataset I found on Kaggle. The purpose of this project is to examine the relationship of student performance with other factors such as parental education level, race/ethnicity, test prep courses, and free/reduced or standard lunch which can be used as a proxy for socioeconomic status. Analysis was performed in R.

This project is a work in progress. I will be adding more to it as time goes on.

## Inferences ##
* What are the major factors influencing exam scores?
* What is the effectiveness of test preparation courses?
* Other inferences
